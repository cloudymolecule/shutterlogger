SHUTTERLOGGER

ShutterLogger is my Flatiron School Sinatra portfolio project.
It's a fully featured 35mm photo logger.
It allows you to keep track of your cameras, lenses, individual photos and even film rolls.


INSTALL INSTRUCTIONS

Clone and fork this project and run your webserver of choice from the root directory, shotgun was my development server of choice.


INSTRUCTIONS

1 - Begin by creating and account, once that's set you can start adding 35mm equipment/photos.

2 - Start adding cameras, then add a lens (or many!) to that camera and add at least one film roll.
    Once a roll is created and added to a camera, that camera will be LOADED. It will remain like
    that until you delete the film roll, or manually unload the camera. Once unloaded the roll
    will have no exposures left, so you can add another and start the process again.

3 - Add some photos. You'll notice that as you do, the exposures on the roll you've selected
    start going down until there's none left at which point you can select another roll to log photos to.

4 - Cameras, lenses, rolls, and photos can all be updated.

TRIVIA

The background camera is a 1978 Canon AE-1 with a F1.4 50MM lens I found at a flea market. I use it to this day :)
